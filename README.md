# Two Birds, One Stonebridge

## Team 2 - Stonebridge

Will Sutton, Eric Mueller, Jase Peeler, Joseph Aguilar

## Overall Goal

In consulting for Stonebridge, we aim to complete a full lifecycle data science project. The objective of this project is to explore the implications of and causes behind the bursting of injection wells. Injection wells are used to dispose of waste water created by the fracking process. More details will be posted here as we further determine the direction of this project.

## Week 7 - Group Kanban Assignment

In this repository, we can see the following project structure:

```
project-root/
├── data/            # AmesHousing.csv (provided dataset)
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter Notebooks
├── results/         # output files (charts, regression results, etc.)
├── README.md        # project description
└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

In this assignment, we conduct exploratory and regression analysis on Ames Housing data (`AmesHousing.csv`).

### Instructions

Using the command line, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install package versions that align our environments.

Then, run the cells in `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` and `regression_analysis.ipynb` sequentially. This will produce the output of our analysis. Commentary on this analysis can be seen within these files.
